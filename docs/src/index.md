# PoGOBase

[PoGOBase](https://github.com/JuliaPokemonGO/PoGOBase.jl) is the base package
for analysis of Pokemon GO. It incorporates data from the so-called *gamemaster*
file, which includes details on all the Pokemon as well as many of the game's
mechanics, together with an extensive set of utility functions.

Things you can do include:

- level, combat power, and stats computations
- work with evolutions and/or mega-evolutions
- analysis of moves in PvP and PvE
- damage computations
- identify and evaluate IVs for battle leagues
- analyze type effectiveness/resistances
- create raid and max battle bosses for damage analysis
- compute power-up and evolution costs
- compute walking distances needed to obtain specific resources
